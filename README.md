## 1. How to setup
- Clone or download the repository.
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:elit-altum/Cryptic-Hunt.git
  ```
- Get a hosted mongoDB Atlas Cluster (Learn More [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPqRyYJmx2g))
- Create a ```config.env``` file on the root of the project and create the following variables there :
  ```
  MONGO_SRV=<SRV string provided while hosting the cluster>

  JWT_SECRET=<any 32 character string for encoding JWTs>

  <Just copy paste the following lines>
  JWT_EXPIRE=7d
  COOKIE_EXPIRE=7
  ```
- Host the created app on Heroku or Netlify for free. (Learn More [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxfxiR8TVNU))
- Do provide the ```config.env``` variables as heroku environment variables as well.

### 2. Creating an admin
- Create/register a new user for yourself using the frontend using the ```/signupAdmin``` route.
- Access this user document on the Mongo cluster on the users collection of the database and make sure you set the ```role``` value as "admin" to grant you admin privileges.

### 3. Adding Questions
- After you have promoted yourself to an admin, enter the questions on the ```/newQuestion``` route, which will only accept a question if you are an admin, otherwise will reject it.
- Make sure you add the level numbers correctly.

Happy Crypting! âœ¨
